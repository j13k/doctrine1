     * Get the stucture of a field into an array

     * @param string    $table         name of the table on which the index is to be created
     * @param string    $name         name of the index to be created
     * @param array     $definition        associative array that defines properties of the index to be created.
     *                                 Currently, only one property named FIELDS is supported. This property
     *                                 is also an associative with the names of the index fields as array
     *                                 indexes. Each entry of this array is set to another type of associative
     *                                 array that specifies properties of the index that are specific to
     *                                 each field.
     *
     *                                Currently, only the sorting property is supported. It should be used
     *                                 to define the sorting direction of the index. It may be set to either
     *                                 ascending or descending.
     *
     *                                Not all DBMS support index sorting direction configuration. The DBMS
     *                                 drivers of those that do not support it ignore this property. Use the
     *                                 function support() to determine whether the DBMS driver can manage indexes.

     *                                 Example
     *                                    array(
     *                                        'fields' => array(
