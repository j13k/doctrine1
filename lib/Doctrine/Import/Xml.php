/**
 * class Doctrine_Import_XML
 *
 * Different methods to import a XML schema. The logic behind using two different
 * methods is simple. Some people will like the idea of producing Doctrine_Record
 * objects directly, which is totally fine. But in fast and growing application,
 * table definitions tend to be a little bit more volatile. importArr() can be used
 * to output a table definition in a PHP file. This file can then be stored 
 * independantly from the object itself.
