Doctrine is an ORM (object relational mapper) for PHP 5.2.x+ that sits on top of a powerful DBAL (database abstraction layer).  
One of its key features is the ability to optionally write database queries in an OO (object oriented) 
SQL-dialect called DQL inspired by Hibernates HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL 
that maintains a maximum of flexibility without requiring needless code duplication.
