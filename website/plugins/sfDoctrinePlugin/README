sfDoctrine symfony plugin
=========================

Overview
--------

The sfDoctrine plugin allows you to totally replace propel with doctrine (http://www.phpdoctrine.com/) which is a powerful and easy-to-use ORM.


Contents
--------

This plugin contains:
- necessary tools to use doctrine: the main tool is sfDoctrine::getTable() which will allow you to send queries
- pake tasks that convert between doctrine and propel schema formats and build doctrine model classes automatically
- an admin generator: to use it just specify sfDoctrineAdmin as the main class in your generator.yml config

You will find more information in the wiki page dedicated to sfDoctrine: http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/sfDoctrine.
