# Upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2

This document details the changes made to Doctrine 1.2 to make it easier for you
to upgrade your projects to use this version.

## Removed Attribute String Support

The string support of `Doctrine_Configurable::getAttribute()` and `Doctrine_Configurable::setAttribute()` have been removed.

The reason is that the performance of this simple convenience feature is significant and it is totally unneeded.

The following code is no longer supported.

    [php]
    $connection->setAttribute('use_native_enum', true);

You must now always use the following code.

    [php]
    $connection->setAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_USE_NATIVE_ENUM, true);

## Removed all Deprecated Functions

Removed all functions labeled `@deprecated` in the doc blocks.

Affected Classes

* Doctrine_Query
* Doctrine_Query_Abstract

## Renamed Methods

* Doctrine_Query_Abstract::getSql() to getSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_Search_Query::getSql() to getSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_Query_Abstract::getCountQuery() to getCountSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_RawSql::getCountQuery() to getCountSqlQuery()
