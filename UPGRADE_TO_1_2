# Upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2

This document details the changes made to Doctrine 1.2 to make it easier for you
to upgrade your projects to use this version.

## Removed Attribute String Support

The string support of `Doctrine_Configurable::getAttribute()` and `Doctrine_Configurable::setAttribute()` have been removed.

The reason is that the performance of this simple convenience feature is significant and it is totally unneeded.

The following code is no longer supported.

    [php]
    $connection->setAttribute('use_native_enum', true);

You must now always use the following code.

    [php]
    $connection->setAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_USE_NATIVE_ENUM, true);

## Removed all Deprecated Functions

Removed all functions labeled `@deprecated` in the doc blocks.

Affected Classes

* Doctrine_Query
* Doctrine_Query_Abstract

## Renamed Methods

* Doctrine_Query_Abstract::getSql() to getSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_Search_Query::getSql() to getSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_Query_Abstract::getCountQuery() to getCountSqlQuery()
* Doctrine_RawSql::getCountQuery() to getCountSqlQuery()

## Added ability to configure base table class for class builder

Introduced option named `baseTableClassName` to configure the class child `Doctrine_Table` instances use which defaults to `Doctrine_Table`.

    [php]
    $builder = new Doctrine_Import_Builder();
    $builder->setOption('baseTableClassName', 'MyBaseTable');

## Added ability to configure query class

Before Doctrine 1.2 it was hard coded internally to always use the `Doctrine_Query` class whenever you instantiate a new query. Now you can configure which class this is to use by setting the `Doctrine::ATTR_QUERY_CLASS` attribute.

    [php]
    class MyQuery extends Doctrine_Query
    {
      
    }

    $manager->setAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_QUERY_CLASS, 'MyQuery');

    $q = Doctrine_Query::create();

    echo get_class($q); // MyQuery

## Changed Doctrine_Parser_Xml::arrayToXml() to be static

Now the `arrayToXml()` method can be called directly because it is static.

    [php]
    $array = array(
      'key1' => 'value',
      'key2' => 'value'
    );
    $xml = Doctrine_Parser_Xml::arrayToXml($array);

## Refactored Migrations to better handle multiple connections

Now when working with `Doctrine_Migration` instance you can specify as the 2nd
argument to the constructor the connection instance to use for the migrations.

Migrations for different databases should be handled with a different set of 
migration classes.

Previous method of finding connection based on the table name is flawed since 
databases could have the same table name multiple times.

    [php]
    $conn = Doctrine_Manager::connection();
    $migration = new Doctrine_Migration('/path/to/migrations', $conn);
