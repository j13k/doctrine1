A common case when looking for ORM tools like Doctrine is that the database and the code that access it is growing large/complex. A more substantial tool is needed then manual SQL code. 

Doctrine has support for generating Doctrine_Record classes from your existing database. There is no need for you to manually write all the Doctrine_Record classes for your domain model.
