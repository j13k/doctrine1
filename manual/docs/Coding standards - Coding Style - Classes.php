* Classes must be named by following the naming conventions.


* The brace is always written right after the class name (or interface declaration).


* Every class must have a documentation block that conforms to the PHPDocumentor standard.


* Any code within a class must be indented four spaces.


* Only one class is permitted per PHP file.


* Placing additional code in a class file is NOT permitted. 

This is an example of an acceptable class declaration:



<code type="php">
/**
 * Documentation here
 */
class Doctrine_SampleClass {
    // entire content of class
    // must be indented four spaces
}
