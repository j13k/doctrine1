All variables must satisfy the following conditions:

<ul>
<li \>Variable names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Underscores are not permitted. Numbers are permitted in variable names but are discouraged.
</ul>

<ul>
<li \>Variable names must always start with a lowercase letter and follow the "camelCaps" capitalization convention.
</ul>

<ul>
<li \>Verbosity is encouraged. Variables should always be as verbose as practical. Terse variable names such as "$i" and "$n" are discouraged for anything other than the smallest loop contexts. If a loop contains more than 20 lines of code, the variables for the indices need to have more descriptive names.
</ul>
