* Line termination is the standard way for Unix text files. Lines must end only with a linefeed (LF). Linefeeds are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.


* Do not use carriage returns (CR) like Macintosh computers (0x0D).


* Do not use the carriage return/linefeed combination (CRLF) as Windows computers (0x0D, 0x0A).
