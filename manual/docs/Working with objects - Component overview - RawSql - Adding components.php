The following example represents a bit harder case where we select all entities and their associated phonenumbers using a left join. Again we
wrap all the columns in curly brackets but we also specify what tables associate to which components.
<br \> <br \>
First we specify that table entity maps to record class 'Entity'
<br \><br \>
Then we specify that table phonenumber maps to Entity.Phonenumber (meaning phonenumber associated with an entity)
