Doctrine_Db_Profiler is an eventlistener for Doctrine_Db. It provides flexible query profiling. Besides the sql strings
the query profiles include elapsed time to run the queries. This allows inspection of the queries that have been performed without the
need for adding extra debugging code to model classes.



Doctrine_Db_Profiler can be enabled by adding it as an eventlistener for Doctrine_Db.
