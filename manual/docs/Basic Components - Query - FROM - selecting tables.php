DQL FROM -part is used for selecting tables as well as for selecting fields. Related components are selected either
with colon-operator or dot-operator (See <a href="documentation.php?index=2.8.php">Relation operators</a>). <br \>You can place
the selected fields in () -brackets (eg. 'FROM User(name, id)'). If you are about to select all fields you can simple use 'FROM User'.
