The boolean data type represents only two values that can be either 1 or 0.
Do not assume that these data types are stored as integers because some DBMS drivers may implement this
type with single character text fields for a matter of efficiency.
Ternary logic is possible by using null as the third possible value that may be assigned to fields of this type.
