Doctrine offers enum data type emulation for all databases. The enum data type of Doctrine maps to
integer on database. Doctrine takes care of converting the enumerated value automatically to its valuelist equivalent when a record is being fetched
and the valuelist value back to its enumerated equivalent when record is being saved.
