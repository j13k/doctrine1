The timestamp data type is a mere combination of the date and the time of the day data types. 
The representation of values of the time stamp type is accomplished by joining the date and time 
string values in a single string joined by a space. Therefore, the format template is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. 
The represented values obey the same rules and ranges described for the date and time data types
