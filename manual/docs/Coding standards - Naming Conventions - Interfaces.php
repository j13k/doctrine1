* Interface classes must follow the same conventions as other classes (see above), however must end with the word "Interface"
(unless the interface is approved not to contain it such as Doctrine_Overloadable). Some examples:




Doctrine_Db_EventListener_Interface   



Doctrine_EventListener_Interface
