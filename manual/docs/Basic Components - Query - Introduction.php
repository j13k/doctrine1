DQL (Doctrine Query Language) is a object query language which allows
you to find objects. DQL understands things like object relationships, polymorphism and 
inheritance (including column aggregation inheritance).

So instead of writing lots of SQL inner and outer joins, unions and subselects yourself,
you can write simple DQL queries where relationships are being referenced with dot-notation.

You can execute DQL queries with Doctrine_Connection::query() method.
